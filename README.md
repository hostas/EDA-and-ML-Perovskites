## The repository contains several subprojects which are sorted into following sections:

1. [Data reading and cleaning](https://github.com/hostas/EDA-and-ML-for-Perovskites/blob/master/README.md) (including a custom made script to read a xlsx human made database file)
2. [EDA (Exploratory data Analysis)](https://github.com/hostas/EDA-and-ML-for-Perovskites/blob/master/README.md)
3. [Feature engineering](https://github.com/hostas/EDA-and-ML-for-Perovskites/blob/master/README.md)
4. [Prediction (Regression)](https://github.com/hostas/EDA-and-ML-for-Perovskites/blob/master/README.md)
5. [Hyperparameter tunning](https://github.com/hostas/EDA-and-ML-for-Perovskites/blob/master/README.md)

I will provide a documentation that explains the code and key takeaways of the project.

Figure 1: Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to visualize data and reduce the number of features that are used in machine learning. Here, I used weight composition descriptor calculated using site and chemical formula information. We can see that principal component 1 is highly correlated with the oxygen content which seems to explain the most of the variance in the data.
