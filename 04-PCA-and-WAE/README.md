# Pricipal Compotent Analysis (PCA) and Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAE)

PCA is often used to reduce a sparse descriptor size and visualize data. Autoencoders have many applications from inverse design to visualization. It would be interesting to use a similar data representation for inverse design, ideally for optimization of more than 1 material property at the time.
