# Regression with hyperparameter optimization

I have used program [tpot](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/) which takes care of both feature engineering and hyperameter search in model optimization.

![Abstract](https://github.com/hostas/EDA-and-ML-for-Perovskites/blob/master/Graphics/Regression.jpg)

**Figure 1**: We can optimize the models for both weight composition and elemental descriptors easily but the performance is quantitatively worse for simpler weight composition descriptor.
